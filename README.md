## Planning and communication

We met several times over Zoom, initially to select a site for the assignment, and then throughout the project 
to work together on discussing some aspect or implementing a solution. We also frequently communicated via email
to report on our progress and check in with the group. By staying in close contact, we were able to effectively
collaborate and quickly solve problems when we hit a snag. We made planning decisions early on, and we divided 
up the bulk of the work at that point. As other, smaller tasks arose, one or another group member would volunteer
to take that on, and the work divided up pretty effortlessly. Through excellent teamwork, this was all fairly seamless.
